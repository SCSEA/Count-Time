# Count-Time

A basic mechanical countdown timer is usually very easy to use. The user manually sets the countdown timer to indicate the amount of time that needs to be counted down and turns it on. These types of timers are very useful for baking, when some dishes require timing so that you can keep track of them. Simple electronic countdown timers are designed to be used again and again in the same way: the user opens the program that runs the countdown timer, enters the necessary information, and starts it running. In both cases, when the countdown timer reaches the designated time, it usually makes some sort of signal such as a sound or light to indicate that the countdown is over.
